This will be a journal of my thought processes and steps taken as I fumble my way through this.
Time is not critical to me on this project, as this is literally being done (at this point) in my spare time.
I hope to squeeze out some time each day, maybe an hour or so, but likely no more than that most of the time, 
and likely less a significant portion of the time.

********** Entry #1 - 3/8/21 **********
I have about an hour before I have to go to work.
- README.MD file created with the first couple of "inspiration" links for me to refer back to.
- Create basic outline HTML file, with pre-filled dates and events at this time...not a timeline yet
-- Currently organizing timeline as an unordered list, consiting of list items with multiple divs. One div
   contains three sub-divs which contain the month, day, and year of the event. The second div in the list item
   contains the text of the event itself in a paragraph.
-- This structure may (almost certainly will) change!
- Also ended up adding VERY basic .CSS file to line up the dates and put a border around the events as a whole
AFTER WORK
- Squeezed in some time after work and managed to create the timeline rule itself in CSS, and update the list item
  styling so that it does not have the default bullet, and added a "bullet" on the timeline for the list items
- Most of this styling (certainly the broad strokes, and several of the finer ones) came almost directly from
  the W3Schools page: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_timeline.asp
- Managed to style a basic arrow onto the side of the timeline items.
- Need to figure out a way (probably much later on) that will allow all of the values to be calculated based on the
  screen size of the viewing device.
