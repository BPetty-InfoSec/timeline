This will be a journal of my thought processes and steps taken as I fumble my way through this.
Time is not critical to me on this project, as this is literally being done (at this point) in my spare time.
I hope to squeeze out some time each day, maybe an hour or so, but likely no more than that most of the time, 
and likely less a significant portion of the time.

********** Entry #1 - 3/8/21 **********
I have about an hour before I have to go to work.
Objectives:
- README.MD file created with the first couple of "inspiration" links for me to refer back to.
- Create basic outline HTML file, with pre-filled dates and events at this time...not a timeline yet
-- Currently organizing timeline as an unordered list, consiting of list items with multiple divs. One div
   contains three sub-divs which contain the month, day, and year of the event. The second div in the list item
   contains the text of the event itself in a paragraph.
-- This structure may (almost certainly will) change!
- Also ended up adding VERY basic .CSS file to line up the dates and put a border around the events as a whole
