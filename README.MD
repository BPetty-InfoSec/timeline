I know that plenty of timeline libraries exist for javascript already.
I know that they are generally pretty easy to use, and likely look better than anything that I will produce here.
Still, this is just something to tinker with as it can involve as little or as much as I want.
Potential areas: HTML & CSS definitely, with some javascript for interactivity. Also, this could be linked to a simple database, which I could automate through Python, passing information using JSON.

That said, I have no idea how far this will go before I get bored with it or jump onto a different project.

At this point, I have minimal practical experience with any of these languages and platforms, due to the fact that my experience was quite a while ago.
